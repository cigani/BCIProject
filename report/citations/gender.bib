abstract = "Questionnaires were administered to a sample of 100 university students (50 males and 50 females) to obtain scores on extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism and a range of work-related attitudes. A number of sex differences emerged both on the personality variables (females scored higher on neuroticism than males; males scored higher on psychoticism than females), and on the work-related attitudes (males were more competitive and money oriented than females; females endorsed the work ethic more than males). These data were intercorrelated to reveal a number of personality trait-work attitude relationships on which further sex differences emerged. "
