	Abstract = {Motor imagery, the `mental rehearsal of motor acts without overt movements', involves either a visual representation (visual imagery, VI) or mental simulation of movement, associated with a kinesthetic feeling (kinetic imagery, KI). Previous brain imaging work suggests that patterns of brain activation differ when comparing execution (E) with either type of imagery but the functional connectivity of the participating networks has not been studied. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural equation modeling, this study elucidates the inter-relationships among the relevant areas for each of the three motor behaviors. Our results suggest that networks underlying these behaviors are not identical, despite the extensive overlap between E and KI. Inputs to M1, which are facilitatory during E, have the opposite effect during KI, suggesting a physiological mechanism whereby the system prevents overt movements. Finally, this study highlights the role of the connection of superior parietal lobule to the supplementary motor area in both types of motor imagery.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of the present work was to investigate the correlation between topographical changes in brain oscillatory activity and the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during a motor imagery (MI) task using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coregistration.  EEG was recorded in 7 healthy subjects inside a 1.5 T MR scanner during the imagination of the kinesthetic experience of movement. A Fast Fourier Transform was applied to EEG signal in the rest and active conditions. We used the event-related-synchronization (ERS)/desynchronization (ERD) approach to characterize where the imagination of movement produces a decrease in alpha and beta power.  The mean alpha map showed ERD decrease localized over the contralateral sensory motor area (SM1c) and a light desynchronization in the ipsilateral sensory motor area (SM1i); whereas the mean beta map showed ERD decrease over the supplementary motor area (SMA). fMRI showed significant activation in SMA, SM1c, SM1i. The correlation is negative in the contralateral side and positive in the ipsilateral side.  Using combined EEG-fMRI signals we obtained useful new information on the description of the changes in oscillatory activity in alpha and beta bands during MI and on the investigation of the sites of BOLD activity as possible sources in generating these rhythms. By correlating BOLD and ERD/ERS we may identify more accurately which regions contribute to changes of the electrical response.},

@article{Pfurtscheller:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We studied the reactivity of EEG rhythms (mu rhythms) in association with the imagination of right hand, left hand, foot, and tongue movement with 60 EEG electrodes in nine able-bodied subjects. During hand motor imagery, the hand mu rhythm blocked or desynchronized in all subjects, whereas an enhancement of the hand area mu rhythm was observed during foot or tongue motor imagery in the majority of the subjects. The frequency of the most reactive components was 11.7 Hz $\pm$0.4 (mean $\pm$SD). While the desynchronized components were broad banded and centered at 10.9 Hz $\pm$0.9, the synchronized components were narrow banded and displayed higher frequencies at 12.0 Hz $\pm$1.0. The discrimination between the four motor imagery tasks based on classification of single EEG trials improved when, in addition to event-related desynchronization (ERD), event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns were induced in at least one or two tasks. This implies that such EEG phenomena may be utilized in a multi-class brain--computer interface (BCI) operated simply by motor imagery.},

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that the premotor cortex plays a role in the selection of motor programs based on environmental context. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the activity of single neurons as monkeys learned visuomotor associations. The hypothesis predicts that task-related premotor cortical activity before learning should differ from that afterward. We found that a substantial population of premotor cortex neurons, over half of those adequately tested, showed the predicted learning-dependent changes in activity. The present findings support a role for premotor cortex in motor preparation, generally, and suggest a specific role in the selection of movements on the basis of arbitrary associations.},

Efficacy of an implanted neuroprosthesis for restoring hand grasp in tetraplegia: a multicenter study. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2001;82:1380-8. Objective: To evaluate an implanted neuroprosthesis that allows tetraplegic users to control grasp and release in 1 hand. Design: Multicenter cohort trial with at least 3 years of follow-up. Function for each participant was compared before and after implantation, and with and without the neuroprosthesis activated. Setting: Tertiary spinal cord injury (SCI) care centers, 8 in the United States, 1 in the United Kingdom, and 1 in Australia. Participants: Fifty-one tetraplegic adults with \{C5\} or \{C6\} SCIs. Intervention: An implanted neuroprosthetic system, in which electric stimulation of the grasping muscles of 1 arm are controlled by using contralateral shoulder movements, and concurrent tendon transfer surgery. Assessed participants' ability to grasp, move, and release standardized objects; degree of assistance required to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), device usage; and user satisfaction. Main Outcome Measures: Pinch force; grasp and release tests; \{ADL\} abilities test and \{ADL\} assessment test; and user satisfaction survey. Results: Pinch force was significantly greater with the neuroprosthesis in all available 50 participants, and grasp-release abilities were improved in 49. All tested participants (49/49) were more independent in performing \{ADLs\} with the neuroprosthesis than they were without it. Home use of the device for regular function and exercise was reported by over 90% of the participants, and satisfaction with the neuroprosthesis was high. Conclusions: The grasping ability provided by the neuroprosthesis is substantial and lasting. The neuroprosthesis is safe, well accepted by users, and offers improved independence for a population without comparable alternatives. {\copyright} 2001 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation },

	Abstract = {Current research in brain computer interface (BCI) technology is advancing beyond preclinical studies, with trials beginning in human patients. To date, these trials have been carried out with several different types of recording interfaces. The success of these devices has varied widely, but different factors such as the level of invasiveness, timescale of recorded information, and ability to maintain stable functionality of the device over a long period of time all must be considered in addition to accuracy in decoding intent when assessing the most practical type of device moving forward. Here, we discuss various approaches to BCIs, distinguishing between devices focusing on control of operations extrinsic to the subject (e.g., prosthetic limbs, computer cursors) and those focusing on control of operations intrinsic to the brain (e.g., using stimulation or external feedback), including closed-loop or adaptive devices. In this discussion, we consider the current challenges facing the translation of various types of BCI technology to eventual human application.},

@article{clinical,
	Abstract = {For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world -- a brain--computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15 years, productive \{BCI\} research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or `locked in', with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day \{BCIs\} determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, \{P300\} potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the \{BCI\} derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the \{BCI\} system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current \{BCIs\} have maximum information transfer rates up to 10--25 bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of \{BCI\} technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that \{BCI\} research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating \{BCI\} performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of \{BCI\} performance; identification of appropriate \{BCI\} applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of \{BCI\} technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, \{BCI\} systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances. },

	Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the first time the non-invasive restoration of hand grasp function in a tetraplegic patient by electroencephalogram (EEG)-recording and functional electrical stimulation (FES) using surface electrodes. The patient was able to generate bursts of beta oscillations in the \{EEG\} by imagination of foot movement. These beta bursts were analyzed and classified by a brain-computer interface (BCI) and the output signal used to control a \{FES\} device. The patient was able to grasp a cylinder with the paralyzed hand. },
