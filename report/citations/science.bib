abstract = "The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the first time the non-invasive restoration of hand grasp function in a tetraplegic patient by electroencephalogram (EEG)-recording and functional electrical stimulation (FES) using surface electrodes. The patient was able to generate bursts of beta oscillations in the \{EEG\} by imagination of foot movement. These beta bursts were analyzed and classified by a brain-computer interface (BCI) and the output signal used to control a \{FES\} device. The patient was able to grasp a cylinder with the paralyzed hand. "
